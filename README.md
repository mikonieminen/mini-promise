# Promises/A+ polyfil

Use it as you would use native promises, with an exception that this one
allows you resolve promise by returning value from executor function.

Originally it was designed to be used with mini-module that provides
node.js kind of module, export and require mechanisms inside a browser
Though nothing prevents it being used on its own.

## Install

node.js component
```sh
npm install mini-promise-aplus
```

bower component
```sh
bower install mini-promise-aplus
```
